# EnzyML
The machine learning based method in predicting enzymes property

## Projects
# Step 1
1. benchmarking the models which using to predict binding affinity of protein-ligand
2. benchmarking the models which using to predict kcat

# Step 2  Robert as a major template of the EnzyML
1.  The current models do not have the Enzyme encoder.
2. The current models only screening the Gradient Boost, the Random forest
